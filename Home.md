## An open resource for an open community

* This is like Wikipedia, but for conferences.
* This wiki [works offline](https://github.com/newhavenrb/conferences/wiki/_access) (which is great for conferences).  It's just a `git` repo full of Markdown files.
* It's more than just notes; we have summaries, discussions, slide/video links, [[presenter info|Yehuda Katz]], mentioned gems, and more.  Miss a talk?  Can't remember the name of something?  We've got your back.

Our goal is to be a **community resource**, making this information as widely usable as possible.  This means having search engine-friendly text, summaries for humans, as well as resources for the deaf, hard of hearing, and speakers of non-English languages (for example, [[summaries in Portugese|David Heinemeier Hansson Keynote PT]] and [[Japanese|David Heinemeier Hansson Keynote JA]]).
