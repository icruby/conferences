## Abstract
* Architecture in Rails, applicatin architecture

## Memorable Quotes
* Software Architecture is a compromise between viability and perfection
* Write programs that handle HTTP and do it well
* When it comes to OO, we should think about messages that pass through objects
* Refactoring is paying your mortgage debt, it eventually becomes too painful that you can't manage it.

## Notes
* Up front design vs. Ad hoc architecture
* lib subfolder becomes the junk jar
* In the beginning, change is relatively easy, but it's getting harder as more features and developers.
* Entropy: little flaws and hacks aggregate overtime
* Layered architectures break down in practice
* API designs: implement an ecosystem of small applications
* Bind applications with APIs and messages
* For API design: think about a caching strategy
* Pick a messaging solution
* Implement observers using a messaging service
* Provide persistence through asynchronous service
* AB testing on applications and infrastructure
