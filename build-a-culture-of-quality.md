## Abstract

* Code Climate

## Memorable Quotes

* Hope is not a plan
* First, do no harm
* Why code review? You Can't Edit Your Own Writing

## Notes

* Presenting Problems: initial symptom motivating the patient to consult an expert.

### Sympton

* Slow progress
* Bug
* Whack a mole
* Viscous Cycle: Pressure -> Slop -> Late -> Pressure -> Slop ...

### Opposing Forces

* Buinsess changes
* Team changes

### Quality agenda

* Qualitative data:
  - one-on-ones: two sided converstaion happens naturally in business
  - Retrospectives: take turns to lead retrospective

* Quantitative data:
  - Process time
  - Software metrics

### Growing quality

* Boy Scout Rule: leave the camp cleaner than you founded
* Refactoring as you go: the goal as the developer is to make refactoring process invisible,
* Leveling up: create style guides 1) write down agreed upon style 2) Ruthless adherence 3) Out-of-band litigation process
* Problem: Not Enough Refactoring Experience
  - Lunch and Learn: watch a recroded talk / invite a speaker to talk about / discuss an article
  - Teamfactoring: spend an hour, pick a piece of code that I know that has a problem, put it on a projector and refactor it together as a team. If it's not ready to ship, toss it.
* Problem: Finding Problems Too Late.
  - Early warning systems: building failures
  - Bugs and quality issues
  - Security vulnerabilities
* Problem: Missing High Level Design
  - Whiteboarding
  - Code Reviews: reframing languages "Github Pull Request"
  - Review cafeteria: 1) Formatting 2) Correctness 3) Scalability 4) Security 5) Comprehension
